Instructions
------------------
This package contains very simple, one-class examples of connecting to
various types of databases. This code DOES NOT follow good OOP architecture
principles and is intended only to simplify the presentation of the steps
necessary to connect to a database and perform commands. For a more
architecturally sound example, see the package "lab1".

Also, please note that the Derby sample requires that you start the sample
database under the "Service" tab.

The MSSQLServer sample connects to a MS-SQL Server 2008 database server on
campus that is reachable (except for Macs) outside the campus.

The Oracle sample were written for an old Oracle database server that we
used to have on campus. That server is long gone. Still the sample code
is useful and instructive.

IMPORTANT: the database drivers for all of these have been provided as ".jar"
files at the root of the project folder. They have already been added to your
"Libraries" folder as well.
